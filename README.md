nonlinear.py is the original notear-mlp. 

sachs.csv is the preprocessed sachs data by removing the header for easier loadind with numpy.loadtxt

$ utils.py $ includes the data generation, plotting, clustering for different environment. 


$ nonlinear\_ourDataNonlinear\_daring.py $ is for testing notear on data generated in DARING's manner nonlinearly. 


$ notearMLP\_experiment\_enviroonment.py $ is for testing different environments. 


$ nonlinear\_castle $ is the modified notear-mlp with addtional y prediction loss added for real data. y_index in notear-mlp indicates which feature is treated as y 


$ sachs\_data\_NOTEAR-MLP.py $ is for testing notear and its modificaitons on real data set (sachs protein data)
usage: 
<pre><code> 
python sachs_data_NOTEARâˆ’MLP.py sachs.csv
</code></pre>
To switch to a differnt version of notear, modify ...
<pre><code> 
import ... as nonlinear
</code></pre>
To use a different feature as label $y$, change the $y\_index$ in $notears\_nonlinear$


$ sachs\_cluster $ is for clustering the sachs as different environment and applying notear-mlp on them. 

usage: 
<pre><code> 
python sachs_cluster.py sachs.csv</code></pre>
